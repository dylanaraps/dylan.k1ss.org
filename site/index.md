I am 22 years old. I have 22 cats. I have $22 to my name. I live on a 22 mile long Greek island with a population of 22 thousand. I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22.

My best friends are nature, mass surveillance, coffee and cigarettes. They
always look out for me. Money is no friend of mine but we do exchange the odd greeting from time to time.
