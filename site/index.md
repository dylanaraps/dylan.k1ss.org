I am 22 years old. I have 22 cats. I have $22 to my name. I live on a 22 mile long Greek island with a population of 22 thousand. I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22.

My best friends are nature, mass surveillance, coffee and cigarettes. They
always look out for me. Money is no friend of mine but we do exchange the odd greeting from time to time.

I am the village wizard and my wand fixes all tablets brought before me.
My price is fish or garden weeds and for the more difficult jobs, I advise consultation with the local priest. The priest takes money.

I like my women how I like my software: open source, bug free and well maintained. I haven't found one yet but all roads lead to Rome eventually. If you're in Italy, I'll be stopping by.
