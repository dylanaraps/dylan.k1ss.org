Seeing a family of four on a single motorcycle. The father in the font driving, the mother at the back and two kids squished in the middle.

Walking into the staff room of the hospital to find every doctor smoking inside the hospital.

Ordering a rooster from the local butcher and being told: "My husband has to strangle a turkey tomorrow, I'll see if he can fit in the rooster as well".

Sitting at a cafe when rumours go round that the tax man is in town and a fake receipt is put on your table.
